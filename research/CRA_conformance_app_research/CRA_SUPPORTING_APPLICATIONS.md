# Directory of CRA Supporting Applications & Services

The European Union's **Cyber Resilience Act (Regulation (EU) 2024/2847)** has catalyzed a rapid emergence of specialized compliance web applications, automated vulnerability disclosure gateways, software supply chain scanners, and Notified Body consulting frameworks.

This directory documents the active ecosystem as of September 2026 (the active Article 14 enforcement era), detailing live web applications, pricing models, feature sets, service architectures, and structural limitations.
